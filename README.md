  ðŸŒˆðŸŒˆ RAINBOW FART OVERLAP MOD

## Summary

**VSCode Rainbow Fart** is an extension made by SaekiRaku that keeps giving you compliments as you code. It will check the keywords in your code to play relevant sounds.

**Overlap Mod** is a fork I made to make my [Gamblecore](https://github.com/pelmeniboiler/gamblecore) soundpack more exciting. I hope it's useful!

> Rainbow Fart is a literal translation word from Chinese, which means giving somebody exaggerated compliment that even seems a little fake. It is not connected to any specific group or individuals.

> Overlap Mod is from English, which refers to the fact that it's a modification of someone else's work that enables sounds to overlap.
